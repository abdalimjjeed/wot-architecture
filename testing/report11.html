<h2 id="h_intro"><a id="intro" name="intro">1. Introduction</a> </h2>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
  document entered the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-architecture-YYYYMMDD/">Candidate Recommendation</a> 
  period for the second time on DD-MM-2022.
</p>
<p>
  The planned date for entering Proposed Recommendation is DD-MM-2022.
  This document summarizes the results from the Web of Things (WoT) TD implementer reports received and
  describes the process that the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group followed in preparing this <em>Implementation Report (IR)</em>.
</p>

<h4 id="h_objectives"><a id="objectives" name="objectives">1.1 Implementation Report objectives</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Must verify that the specification is implementable.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="h_non_objectives"><a id="non_objectives" name="non_objectives">1.2 Implementation Report non-objectives</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>The IR does not attempt full conformance testing of implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although results were generated with a combination of automated and manual tests,
  the automated tests were only meant to provide assistance to implementers in preparing their individual implementation
  test reports.
</p>

<h2 id="h_cr_work"><a id="cr_work" name="cr_work">2. Work during the Candidate Recommendation period</a></h2>
<p>
  During the CR period, the Working Group carried out the following activities:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Clarification and improvement through the exposition of the specification</li>
	<li>Disposing of comments that were communicated to the WG during the CR period.
        These comments and their resolution are detailed in the
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/issues">GitHub Issue tracker</a>
        with the label <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/issues?q=label%3A%22CR+period%22">CR&nbsp;period</a>.</li>
	<li>Preparation of this Implementation Report.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_participate"><a id="participate" name="participate">3. Participating in the Implementation Report</a></h2>
<p>
  Implementers were invited to contribute to the assessment of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-wot-architecture-2022MMDD/">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture Candidate Recommendation</a>
  by submitting implementer reports describing the
  coverage of their implementations with respect to the test assertions outlined
  in the <a href="#automated_validation_results">table below</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Implementer reports were collected through the W3C WoT Interest Group's
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/07/wot-ig-charter.html#scope">PlugFest</a> activity and collected
  in the GitHub repository
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/master/testing/tests/2019-05/">https://github.com/w3c/wot</a>
  under <code>testing/tests/2019-05/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Comments on this document, or requests made for
  further information were posted to the Working Group's public
  mailing list <a href="mailto:public-wot-wg@w3.org">wot-wg@w3.org</a>
  (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-wg/">archive</a>)
  and as issues on the GitHub repository

</p>

<h2 id="h_pr_entrance_crit"><a id="pr_entrance_crit" name="pr_entrance_crit">4. Entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase</a></h2>
<p>
  The Web of Things (WoT) Working Group established the following
  entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase in the
  Request for CR:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been
    gathered to demonstrate interoperabilty.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specific Implementation Report requirements (<a href="#report_reqs">outlined below</a>) have been met.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Working Group has formally addressed and responded to all
    public comments received by the Working Group.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All three of these criteria have been met.
<!--
  Hard to count since some implementations have multiple components, and some are shared.  Omit.
  A total of N implementations were documented by M different organizations.
-->
  The testimonials below indicate the broad base of support
  for the specification. All of the required features had at least
  two implementations.
  All of the optional features also received at least one implementation.
  However, these optional features do not have
  conformance requirements that have an impact on interoperability.
</p>

<h2 id="h_report_reqs"><a id="report_reqs" name="report_reqs">5. Implementation Report requirements</a></h2>

<h4 id="h_DetailedReqs"><a id="DetailedReqs" name="DetailedReqs">5.1 Detailed requirements</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>
    Testimonials from implementers are included in the IR when
    provided to document the utility and implementability of the
    specification.
  </li>
	<li>
    IR must cover all specified features in the specification. For
    each feature the IR should indicate:
    <ul>
	     <li>Feature status: required, optional, other.</li>
	     <li>Feature utility/usefulness based on feedback from implementers.</li>
	     <li>Implementability of the feature specification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Feature status is a factor in test coverage in the report:
    <ul>
		  <li>
        Required specification features must have at least two
        implementations. Implementations that do not implement a required
        specification feature must document the reason for not implementing
        the feature.
      </li>
		  <li>
        Optional specification features must have at least one implementation.
        Implementations that do not implement an optional specification
        feature should document the reason for not implementing the feature.
      </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Feature status is in practice indicated by
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC&nbsp;2119</a> assertions
  associated with the feature.  Features defined using any assertions
  containing the words MUST are considered required.
  Features defined using MAY and SHOULD assertions are considered optional.
</p>

<h4 id="h_NotesOnTesting"><a id="NotesOnTesting" name="NotesOnTesting">5.2 Notes on testing</a></h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    An implementer report must indicate the outcome of evaluating 
    the implementation with respect to each of the assertions defined in the specification.
    Possible outcomes are <code>pass</code>, <code>fail</code>, or <code>not-impl</code> (not implemented).
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="h_out_of_scope"><a id="out_of_scope" name="out_of_scope">5.3 Out of scope</a></h4>
<p>This implementation Report will not cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conformance testing results</li>
  <li>Interoperability testing results</li>
  <li>All possible combinations of Things that TDs could describe (since this is an infinite set)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_systems"><a id="test-systems" name="test-systems">6. Systems</a></h2>
<p>
  This section contains descriptions of each of the implementations
  of the WoT Architecture specification
  from all organizations that submitted implementer reports.
  Each implementation represents a working system
  that is based on the WoT Architecture.
</p>
<p>
  We only count systems with mostly independent code bases
  as distinct implementations.
  There are however some cases (documented in the following) where
  implementations shared components but were still considered substantially
  independent implementations.  In cases where a substantial component
  was shared across implementations the features supported by that
  component were only counted once.

<h3>Hitachi, Ltd.</h3>   
<div class="testimonial">
<p>
Hitachi understands the importance of standardization
to make the world seamlessly connected, and strongly supports W3C's activities.
</p>
<p>
Hitachi expects that standardization of Web of Things enables easy integration
across various Things and IoT platforms.  We create a tool for
rapid application development using Node-RED,
called Node generator.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="impl-hitachi-nodegen">Node generator for Node-RED: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodegen">Node generator</a> is command line tool to generate <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> node modules from several
 various sources including Thing Description of Web of Things. 
 Using this tool, node developers can dramatically reduce their time

</div><div class="impl" id="impl-intel">
<h3>Intel Corporation</h3>   
<div class="testimonial">
<p>
Intel supports this specification as it enables interoperation between devices
from different manufacturers, supporting the growth of an ecosystem of interoperating
IoT services and easing barriers to adoption.
</p>
<p>
Three separate implementations were developed, all based on Node.js.
The core implementations focused on basic local network access without built-in security.
A separate project, used by all three implementations, provided security (encryption and
authentication) by means of a reverse proxy. 
For the purposes of validation this reverse proxy was considered a shared component of all three implementations, 
and the features it implemented were only counted once in the results.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="impl-intel-security">Security Proxy: Shared Component</h4>
<p>
This component, shared across all implementations provided by Intel, was a reverse proxy service that provided
authentication (via various mechanisms indicated by the schemes indicated in the Thing
Description) and encrypted transport termination.
The reverse proxy service was made accessible over a secure tunnel, and depending on the circumstances,
was run in the cloud, on a gateway computer, or locally on a device.
As this component implemented the security features in all other implementations
from Intel, for the purposes of validation
these features are only recorded as being supported in a single implementation.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-intel-ocf">OCF Metadata Translator: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
This implementation translated metadata made available by devices implemented using
the OCF standard and re-expressed that metadata in the form of WoT Thing Descriptions.
The actual network interfaces were however provided either by the OCF devices themselves
directly via CoAP, or via a CoAP/HTTP bridge developed by OCF. 
The metadata
translator also had the ability to add semantic markup to the generated WoT Thing Descriptions,
using a database that related OCF Resource Types to iotschema.org capabilities.
It also had the capability to register generated TDs with directory services.
Secure interfaces (e.g. HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface provided by the OCF CoAP/HTTP bridge.
</p>
<p>
The OCF devices were based on the OCF Smart Home Demo and included both
real and simulated devices. Real devices used for testing included
</p><ol>
<li>ON\OFF Lights (various: MOSFET, Relay, LEDs),</li>
<li>RGB Light,</li>
<li>Potentiometer (analog input),</li>
<li>Toggle Switch,</li>
<li>Pushbutton,</li>
<li>IR Motion Sensor,</li>
<li>Illuminance Sensor, and</li>
<li>Buzzer.</li>
</ol>
There were also multiple instances of many of these devices, each given 
unique identifiers.
<p></p>

<h4 id="impl-intel-speak">WebSpeak: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
This implementation provided a service to convert text to speech.  English
text set to its network interface was spoken audibily.  This service was used to
test several accessibility scenarios, including automatic conversion of visible status
and event information to spoken announcements in order to support blind users.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were generated using a template mechanism,
and the service also had the capability to automatically register these
TDs with a directory service.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-intel-camera">Simple Web Camera: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
This implementation provided a service to capture still images from a camera
and provide them over its network interface.  This was used to test various aspects
of actions, including support for inputs and outputs with different content types.
The service was also capaple of introspecting the parameters made available via any
particular attached video4linux camera
and made those parameters available as WoT Thing Description properties.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were generated using a template mechanism,
and the service also had the capability to automatically register these
TDs with a directory service.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-intel-inference">Object Identifier: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
This implementation provided a service to detect, recognize, and localize
objects in an image using a hardware-accelerated neural network.
This was implemented using a service running on a gateway.
This was used to test various aspects of actions, 
including support for inputs and outputs with different content types,
but in an opposite way to the camera. The camera accepted JSON to localize a
region of interest and output an image; the object identification
service took a JPEG image and output JSON listing the objects recognized and
their location.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were generated using a template mechanism,
and the service also had the capability to automatically register these
TDs with a directory service.

</div><div class="impl" id="impl-siemens">   
<h3>Siemens AG</h3>   
<div class="testimonial">
<p>
Siemens supports this specification as it allows manufacturers
to attach metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way.
The extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular remedies interoperability challenges 
with an installed base of long-lived industrial devices.
Furthermore, 
this specification is a central building block for several digitalization topics such as 
device onboarding, 
device management, 
digital twins, 
and 
data analytics.
</p>
<p>
Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of Things, 
which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb project.
Siemens also implemented concepts of this specification in products and 
aims at aligning the implementations and opening the features to customers 
once this specification reaches REC status.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="impl-siemens-node-wot">node-wot: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The node-wot implementation is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs to instantiate Consumed Things 
and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
The node-wot implementation supports several Protocol Bindings including 
HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, and MQTT,
with corresponding security mechanisms such as 
DTLS (CoAP); 
TLS (HTTP, MQTT),
Basic, Digest, and Bearer Token authentication (HTTP), 
PSK (CoAP), and 
username/password authentication (MQTT). 
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-thingweb-directory">Thingweb Directory: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The Thingweb Directory provides a directory service written in Java to register TDs 
and look them up through queries (primarily SPARQL).
The implementation consumes TDs registered with it through a web API,
represent their metadata in a KnowledgeGraph, and (re-)produces TDs to return the results of queries.
Currently it supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-wot-fxui">WoT-fxUI: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
WoT-fxUI is a generic user interface (UI) for Things based on Java with JavaFX.
It consumes TDs to render UI elements that allow human users to interact with Things.
The implementation currently supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.

<h2 id="h_security"><a id="security" name="security">7. Security</a></h2>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
  specification describes systems that include features to support security.
  Functional aspects of assertions associated with security features are validated
  in the same fashion as other functional features.
  In addition, however, the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/12/wot-wg-2016.html">Web of Things (WoT) WG Charter</a>
  requires the development of a test plan.
  An appropriate security test plan, including a description
  of how existing web service penetration testing tools can be used,
  in addition to a description of more general security and privacy considerations,
  is included in
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security">Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Guidelines</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="h_test_results"><a id="test_results" name="test_results">8. Test results</a></h2>
<p>
  The aim of this section is to summarize the assertions from the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
  document and summarize the results from the implementation
  reports received in the CR period.
  The tables in each section below lists all assertions derived from the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
  document.
  The results are broken into two parts: 
  those for which automated testing has been implemented,
  and those for which it has not and manual testing and reporting was necessary.
</p>
<p>
  The headers for these tables are described as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>ID</b> column uniquely identifies the assertion.
    and links to the assertion in the context of the specification.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Category</b> column groups assertions by function.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Req</b> column is a Y/N value indicating
    whether the assertion is for a feature which is required.
    Note however that the feature may only be required if another feature is
    also used or in a particular context, as indicated in
    the <b>Context</b> column.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Context</b> column indicates that the "required" status of this feature depends on the use
    of other features.
    If the context is itself optional,
    then the value of <b>Req</b> actually indicates whether the feature is required
    if the indicated context exists.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Assertion</b> column specifies the constraint which must be met.
    Note that this text may contain errors as it is automatically drawn
    from the specification source before ReSpec processing, so automatic
    content provided by ReSpec such as section headings will be missing.
    If the assertion is actually given in a tabular form in the
    specification, appropriate text is generated but this may not match the
    text in the specification itself.  To fully understand the assertion please
    look at the assertion in context in the specification using the provided
    hyperlink.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Parent</b> column indicates another more general assertion that this one is a specialization of.
    A specialization indicates a more restrictive context or provides additional detail to facilitate testing.
    The more general assertion is only considered to have a "pass" status if all its required
    or implmented specializations in a given implementation have a "pass" status.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Result</b> column is annotated with the number of
    <code>pass</code> (<b>P</b>),
    <code>fail</code> (<b>F</b>), and
    <code>not-impl</code> (<b>N</b>)
    status results in the individual implementer reports.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>T</b> column indicates the total number of implementations (or implementation components in the case
    of shared components) reporting a status (of any kind) on each assertion.
    The totals do not sum to a consistent value since not all implementations have provided information on all
    assertions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the case of assertions with multiple mutually exclusive options (for example, enumerated values)
  each of these options may be tested separately and the results combined.
  In this case the 'pass' and 'total' values reported are the minimum value of any of the more detailed tests,
  while the 'fail' and 'not implemented' values report the maximum value of any of these tests.
  Since minimum and maximum value may be drawn from different detailed tests, the
  sum of the 'pass', 'fail', and 'not implemented' cases may not equal the 'total'.
  Instead the total represents the number of implementations for which all options were tested.
  For such cases the "child" assertions have underscores in their names
  prior to each value tested and the table row is also rendered in a 
  different color.
