13,"arch-rel-types","not-impl",,"Extension relation types MUST be compared as strings using ASCII case-insensitive comparison, (c.f. ASCII case insensitive). (If they are serialized in a different format they are to be converted to URIs)."
14,"arch-rel-type-lowercase","pass",,"Nevertheless, all-lowercase URIs SHOULD be used for extension relation types [RFC8288]."
15,"arch-form-iris","pass",,"Form contexts and submission targets MUST both be Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987]."

20,"arch-hypermedia","pass",,"Interaction Affordances MUST include one or more Protocol Bindings."
21,"arch-hypermedia-protocol-binding","pass",,"Protocol Bindings MUST be serialized as hypermedia controls to be self-descriptive on how to activate the Interaction Affordance."
22,"arch-hypermedia-caching","not-impl",,"The hypermedia controls MAY be cached outside the Thing and used for offline processing if caching metadata is available to determine the freshness."
23,"arch-media-type","pass",,"All data (a.k.a. content) exchanged when activating Interaction Affordances MUST be identified by a media type [RFC2046] in the Protocol Binding."
24,"arch-media-type-extra","not-impl",,"Protocol Bindings MAY have additional information that specifies representation formats in more detail than the media type alone."
25,"arch-schema","pass",,"Thus, the Interaction Affordance for structured data types SHOULD be associated with a data schema to provide more detailed syntactic metadata for the data exchanged."
26,"arch-intermediary-td-extra-protocols","pass",,"If necessary, a TD generated by an Intermediary MAY contain interfaces for other communication protocols."
27,"arch-security-consideration-separate-security-data","pass",,"There SHOULD be a strict separation of Public Security Metadata and Private Security Data."

29,"arch-security-consideration-no-private-security-data","pass",,"Producers of TDs MUST ensure that no Private Security Data is included in TDs."
30,"arch-security-consideration-communication-binding","pass",,"Whenever possible, TD creators SHOULD use the vetted communication metadata provided in the WoT Binding Templates."
31,"arch-security-consideration-communication-platform","pass",,"When generating TDs for an IoT ecosystem not covered by the WoT Binding Templates, TD creators SHOULD ensure that all the security requirements of the IoT Platform are satisfied."
32,"arch-security-consideration-isolation-sensitive","pass",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD perform isolation of script instances and their data from each other in cases when scripts handle sensitive data."
33,"arch-security-consideration-isolation-tenants","pass",,"Similarly, the WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD perform isolation of WoT Runtime instances and their data from each other if a WoT device has more than one tenant."
34,"arch-security-consideration-avoid-direct","pass",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD NOT directly expose native device interfaces to the script developers."
35,"arch-security-consideration-use-hal","pass",,"A WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD provide a hardware abstraction layer for accessing the native device interfaces."
36,"arch-security-consideration-hal-refuse-unsafe","not-impl",,"Hardware abstraction layers SHOULD refuse to execute commands that might put the device (or environment) to an unsafe state."
37,"arch-security-consideration-secure-update","pass",,"Post-manufacturing provisioning or update of scripts, the WoT Runtime itself or any related data SHOULD be done in a secure fashion."
38,"arch-security-consideration-secure-cred-storage","pass",,"The WoT Runtime SHOULD securely store any provisioned security credentials, guaranteeing their integrity and confidentiality."
39,"arch-security-consideration-secure-cred-isolation","pass",,"In case there are more than one tenant on a single WoT-enabled device, a WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD isolate each tenant's provisioned security credentials from other tenants."
40,"arch-security-consideration-no-expose-cred","not-impl",,"In order to minimize a risk that provisioned security credentials get compromised, the WoT Runtime implementation SHOULD NOT expose any API for scripts to query provisioned security credentials."
41,"arch-security-consideration-limit-cred-access","not-impl",,"Such credentials (or even better, abstract operations that use them but do not expose them) SHOULD only be accessible to the underlying protocol implementation that uses them."
42,"arch-security-consideration-limit-trust","pass",,"Trust relationships SHOULD be as restricted as possible, ideally pairwise and limited to precisely the access required."
43,"arch-security-consideration-segmented-network","pass",,"In the case of implicit access control via access to a common network a segmented network SHOULD be used."
44,"arch-security-consideration-use-psk","null",,"In commercial and industrial environments, explicit installation of pre-shared keys SHOULD be used to allow browsers to access local services while using TLS."
45,"arch-security-consideration-tls-mandatory-pub","pass",,"When a Thing is made available on the public internet so it can be accessed by anyone, from anywhere, then it MUST be protected by secure transport such as TLS or DTLS."
46,"arch-security-consideration-tls-recommended-priv","not-impl",,"When a Thing is made available on a private network then it SHOULD be protected by secure transport such as TLS or DTLS."
47,"arch-security-consideration-tls-optional-on-lan","pass",,"Private networks such as a LAN, protected by a firewall, MAY use the Trusted Environment approach of depending on network security only."
48,"arch-security-consideration-tls-1-3","not-impl",,"When secure transport over TCP is appropriate, then at least TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] SHOULD be used."
49,"arch-security-consideration-tls-1-2","pass",,"If TLS 1.3 cannot be used for compatibility reasons but secure transport over TCP is appropriate, TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] MAY be used."
50,"arch-security-consideration-dtls-1-3","not-impl",,"When secure transport over UDP is appropriate, then at least DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] SHOULD be used."
