  <h3>Bosch.IO GmbH</h3>
  <p>
    Bosch.IO is convinced that I(o)T cannot be done alone and that collaboration
    via Open Source software and open standards are key to provide
    interoperability in the heterogenous IoT landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reached the conclusion that WoT Thing Models are a very capable modeling
    approach to describe capabilities of thing/device classes, having the
    benefit of relying on JSON-LD for providing additional semantic context.
    What we were seeking for, modeling thing/device classes, is even taken one
    step further by being able to introspect a thing's capabilities on the
    instance level via its WoT Thing Description, including its API endpoints.
  </p>
  <p>
    By adopting the latest W3C Working Draft 11 March 2022 of WoT Thing Description
    1.1 in Eclipse Ditto, an Open Source Digital Twin framework initiated by
    Bosch.IO and still under very active development, Ditto can link to Thing
    Models and automatically create and provide Thing Descriptions for its
    managed digital twins.
