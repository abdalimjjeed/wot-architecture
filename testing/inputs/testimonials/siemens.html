    <p>
      Siemens supports this specification as it allows manufacturers to attach
      metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way. The
      extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular
      remedies interoperability challenges with an installed base of long-lived
      industrial devices. Furthermore, this specification is a central building
      block for several digitalization topics such as device onboarding, device
      management, digital twins, and data analytics.

      Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of
      Things, which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb and Eclipse
      EdiTDor projects.
