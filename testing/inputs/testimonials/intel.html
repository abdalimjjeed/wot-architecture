    Intel supports this specification as it enables interoperation between devices
    from different manufacturers, supporting the growth of an ecosystem of interoperating
    IoT services and easing barriers to adoption.

    Two TD Exposers (Things) were developed and a security proxy were developed, all based on Node.js.
    The Things focused on supporting basic local network access without built-in access controls.
    A separate project, used by all the TD Exposers, provided security (encryption and
    authentication) by means of a reverse proxy.
    For the purposes of counting implementations, the two TD Exposers were considered one
    implementation since they share a significant amount of code.
