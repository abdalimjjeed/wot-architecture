  <p>
    The MQTT Experimental is an MQTT-based Thing implementation that aims to test different WoT operations together with the Data Schema variations that 
    can exist in a TD.
    It is implemented in Python and can act as a way to verify interoperability between different MQTT Binding implementations.
