    <h4>SDF-WoT-Converter: Tool</h4>
    <p>
        The SDF-WoT-Converter is a Python-based conversion tool between WoT data models (TDs and TMs) and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-asdf-sdf/">Semantic Definition Format (SDF)</a>, an IETF specification that strives to be a common data format for IoT device descriptions.
        The implementation provides a library API for using it in Python projects as well as a command-line interface after installing it via the Python package manager <code>pip</code>.
        Besides converting between WoT data models and SDF, the implementation also supports the conversion between TDs and TMs.
