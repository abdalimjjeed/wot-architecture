# Results of Societal Impact self-review for Web of Things (WoT) 

This document was prepared by the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group,
responding to the questions raised in the February 9, 2023 version of the 
[Societal Impact Questionnaire](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/draft-finding-societal-impact-questionnaire-20230209/) document published by the W3C and required as part of the 
wide review process.

These responses relate to all WoT deliverables being developed as part of the current charter.
In some cases a question needs to be considered with respect to a particular deliverable,
and these will be identified when necessary:
* For the WoT system as a whole we include a set of responses associated with the
[Web of Things (WoT) Architecture](https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture) document.
* The [Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description) 
specification is about a metadata information model 
and a file format expressing it, and fulfills a similar function to HTML. 
Responses related to the information model and the metadata encoding will be associated with this document.
* The [Web of Things (WoT) Discovery](https://github.com/w3c/wot-discovery) specification
describes how WoT Thing Descriptions are delivered to WoT Consumers, with WoT Consumers being
an analogue to browsers and WoT Discovery being an analogue to the HTTP protocol content delivery
mechanism.  
Responses related to content delivery will be associated with this document.
* There is also a [Web of Things (WoT) Profile](https://github.com/w3c/wot-profile) specification
describing constraints on certain WoT Implementations to achieve out-of-the-box interoperability.

In the following we have used this mapping to interpret the various questions.
For example, if a question or part of a question is relevant to content delivery
then we will consider it in whole or in part as relating to the Discovery deliverable,
as opposed to the Thing Description deliverable.
